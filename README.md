# Network-Tracking
This Python script parses captured network traffic from a `.pcap` file (e.g., exported from Wireshark), extracts IP address pairs, geolocates them using the MaxMind GeoLiteCity database, and generates a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file for visualizing network paths in Google Maps.
